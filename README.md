# Git-Simple-Guide

Oh, you came here to learn some common git commands?

## How to make your git project.

1. git --version - this command will check if you have git on your machine

2. git init - this command initialise git in your respository (make sure that you've selected the right folder and that you actually have git installed on your machine)

### From now on everything in your folder can be tracked with git, to do this, after you've created some files or made changes, do the following:

1. git add . - this command tells git to start tracking everything in your current folder

2. git add -A - this commands adds every file from your project folder (where git was initialised)


Just README file with common git commands (and maybe images) so you can learn them or refrefresh your memory
